# iOS-SwiftUI

To customize a SwiftUI view, you call methods called *modifiers*. Modifiers wrap a view to change its display or other properties. Each modifier returns a new view, so itâ€™s common to chain multiple modifiers, stacked vertically.

A *spacer* expands to make its containing view use all of the space of its parent view, instead of having its size defined only by its contents.

The `Circle` type is a shape that you can use as a mask, or as a view by giving the circle a stroke or fill.
